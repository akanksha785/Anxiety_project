# Anxiety

The gut microbiota has been identified as an essential component of mood disorders. Individuals
with active mood disorders, such as depression or anxiety, harbors a distinct community of
microorganisms (e.g., bacteria, fungi, viruses) in their gastrointestinal tract. Yet, this area of
research has been barely extended to mood disorders during the pregnancy and the postpartum
period. It is important to understand biological changes over the perinatal period in relation to the
gut microbiota and brain (the gut-brain axis) that may lead to perinatal anxiety as perinatal anxiety
is common (~20%) and leads to negative consequences for the mother and the infant (e.g.,
preterm birth, neurological delays). The objectives of this research are: 
i) to establish associations between maternal gut microbiota and anxiety levels during the perinatal time.
